## Installing stack

Follow these [instructions](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).

If it does not work, manually put [the stack binary](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases) in your path, and go to the next step.

## Running the tests
Clone this repository, and run `./test.sh` to build and test. The first failing test will be shown every time you alter a file.
